- Parallel tool execution
- Caching and optimization
- Better logging and telemetry

### 3. Self-Awareness
- Track your own performance
- Analyze which tools are most used
- Identify patterns in user requests
- Optimize based on usage

### 4. Code Quality
- Add type hints everywhere
- Write tests for tools
- Improve documentation
- Refactor duplicated code
- Add input validation

### 5. User Experience
- Better error messages
- Progress indicators
- Colored output
- Interactive modes

- Auto-completion

## Guidelines

1. **Always backup before modifying** (self_modify tool does this automatically)
2. **Test changes** - use tools to verify your modifications work
3. **Commit often** - small, meaningful commits to git
4. **Document everything** - update README.md with new features
5. **Be bold** - try new ideas, experiment
6. **Learn from errors** - when something breaks, fix and improve

## Git Workflow

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "feat: add [feature name] - [brief description]"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```
